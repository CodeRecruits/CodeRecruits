- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeRecruits ... 2022 is coming 🎉 any new year resolution?

- 👀 I’m interested in all the great projects and specifically the amazing developers that sit behind it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of C++ and C# as a hobby but i am pretty terrible I must admit .I admire all the great coders on GH.

- 💞️ I am good a tech talent recruiting however, working with some of the best tech companies in both London and Amsterdam including WILDLY fast-growing tech scaleups. I could go on but we all know how many DMs you're probably getting these days.

- 📫 If you want to reach me... I'd like to know more about your aspirations and see if you'd like to join a fast-growing company any time soon. Yes i will get a commmission from a placement but only of course if you are placed in the perfect role for you :) 
so don't be stranger... say hi at martin.walsh@hrchange.co.uk
